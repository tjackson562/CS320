How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by creating a JUnit test. This class has taught me how to follow assignment and project requirements and create tests that ensure high coverage percentages.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I would start by separating the requirements into individual tasks. In this class, some of the requirements included a maximum length for the user's ID, First Name, Last Name, Descriptions, and Current Date. I tested each of these requirements individually within the programs to make sure that every user need was sufficiently met.
How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software, at least in this class, has been breaking down the task. I would first write the code to the best of my knowledge, then I would research other ways my code can be refined. Learning as I code new ways that can make my code more efficient and less messy.
